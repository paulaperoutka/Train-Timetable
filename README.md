## Motivation
Using firebase as an introduction to database storage, this train scheduler allows users to view upcoming trains as well as dynamically render new trains they wish to add to the schedule.  
Additional focus includes UNIX conversion using moment.js.

## Instructions
Watch for incoming train schedules, and add new trains to the database. <br />
All train times are converted from UNIX time to EST. <br />
After each train arrival, the next train time is automatically inserted and countdown for next arrival beings.  Schedules reset every 24 hours.

## Credits
The City of Madrid for their beautiful train Station at Atocha.
